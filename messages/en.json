      "intro": "For oboe, bassoon, contrabassoon. Can be adapted for any other double reed instrument.",
      "uniqueFeature": "This unique tip-profiling machine can copy from a model as well as directly from a reed.",
      "functionsTitle": "This unique tip-profiling machine has 3 functions:",
      "function1": "It can be used as a tip-profiling machine by copying from a template onto the reed blank. The entire surface of the reed is machined by a fine special ball-end cutter running at 20,000 rpm, producing an almost polished finish.",
      "function2": "With this special cutter, you can also directly copy a reed, i.e., copy from reed to reed. For this, the included tongue is mounted with a template on the tongue carrier. A counterweight ensures that the tracing ball doesn't travel over the reed with too much pressure.",
      "function3": "It is also possible to copy from a reed onto a pre-milled brass template, thus creating a new, custom template for use with the tip-profiling machine.",
      "benefits": "Working with the optimized standard model results in instantly playable reeds – no more tedious break-in time necessary! If the reed has a few days or more after tip-profiling to adjust to the new thickness ratios, you will have saved at least a week of scraping and playing-in time when you begin to break in these reeds! A beneficial side effect is that you can very quickly assess how good the cane is and how good the quality of the finished reed will be. With this template, it is possible to produce many good reeds in a short time.",
      "cutterInfo": "The special cutter is good for many, many reeds and is available at a very reasonable price. This specialized cutter, set on a high-speed spindle, produces a very fine finish."
